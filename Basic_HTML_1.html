	<p><font color="coral">Wolves, and their dog descendants, likely derived significant benefits from living in human camps â€“ more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed.</font></p>
	<p><font color="#3CB371">The cohabitation of dogs and humans likely improved the chances of survival for early human groups, and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success.</font></p>
